## 👨‍💻 About Me

- **Name:** Abdelrahman Yasser
- **Background:** Fullstack Developer Backend foucs (Laravel,Typescript: MERN & Next.js, DevOps basics)
- **Role:** Backend Developer @ Code root
- **Portfolio:** https://abdoyasser.vercel.app
- **Goal:** Become a **Full-Stack AI Engineer** capable of building:

- RAG systems
- AI Agents
- Vector DB pipelines
- Embeddings & LLM orchestration
- Automation workflows
- Data engineering mini-pipelines

---

## 📘 Repository Purpose

This repo documents my full learning track:

- **Advanced Python**
- **Numpy & Pandas**
- **PyTorch fundamentals**
- **LangChain & LLM Ops**
- **Vector Databases (Chroma / Pinecone / LanceDB)**
- **Embeddings (OpenAI / HuggingFace)**
- **RAG systems (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
- **AI Agents & Tools**
- **Automation & deployment**

Each topic is divided into tasks that I complete one-by-one.

## 🏁 Goals for Companies Reading This

I want this repo to demonstrate:

- Strong foundations in **AI engineering**, not just ML.
- Ability to build **production-ready AI apps**.
- Solid understanding of **vector databases and embeddings**.
- Capability to design **end-to-end systems (backend + AI)**.

This repository showcases both **learning + real projects**.
